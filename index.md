## Currently

As is often the case for College students, I'm currently interested in transitioning from a very wide but shallow T skill set starting with Web Development (UX/UI and Apps) as a first step.

We live in a transitory stage where the bulk of the development efforts asked of us is moving from titanic monolithic waterfall designed systems to agile sharded distributed
systems (whether they be serviced locally or on cloud systems) as such now more than ever mastering the fundamental web principles is key and the bulk of my interest is 
in how to take advantage of it.



### Research interests

Web Development, Blockhain, Cloud computing, DevOps and Data science.


## Education

`2019-now`
