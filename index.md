## Currently

<p style="text-align: justify">As is often the case for College students, I'm currently interested in transitioning from a very wide but shallow T skill set starting with Web Development (UX/UI and Apps) as a first step to get real life experience in the real world. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">We live in a transitory stage where the bulk of the development efforts asked of us is moving from titanic monolithic waterfall designed systems to agile sharded distributed systems (whether they be serviced locally or on cloud providers) as such now more than ever mastering the fundamental web principles is key and the bulk of my interest is in how to navigate the ecosystem. </p>



### Research interests

Web Development, Blockchain, Cloud computing, DevOps and Data science.
